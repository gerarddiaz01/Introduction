# 👋 Hi, I'm Gerard — Future Full Stack Developer

I'm currently on a journey to become a full stack developer, learning by doing, building real projects, and sharing my growth along the way. I’m passionate about solving problems with code and committed to mastering both front-end and back-end development.

---

## 🧠 About Me

- 🧩 I believe that programming is a tool for thinking, not just building.
- 🎯 I'm focused on deep learning, not shortcuts — each project is a step in my evolution.
- 📚 I document not just what I create, but how and why I created it.
- 🌍 Multilingual and curious by nature, I thrive in international, creative environments.

I'm not here just to code — I'm here to **understand, grow, and build meaningful digital experiences**.

---

## 🚀 My Vision

My GitHub isn’t just a showcase — it’s a learning journal.

Each repository includes:
- 🧪 What I experimented with
- 🧱 What I built and how
- 💡 What I learned and improved
- 🔁 What I’d do differently next time

I want my portfolio to reflect not just my skills, but my journey, my mindset, and the kind of developer I’m becoming.

---

## 🛠️ Skills in Progress

- **Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Concepts**: Algorithms, Data Handling, Web Development, Automation  
- **Mindset**: Resilient, Curious, Self-taught & Self-aware

I’m currently expanding into full-stack frameworks, system design, and interface development.
